/**
Time intervals are irregular! For example, there are 60 seconds in a minute, but 24 hours in a day. Even more confusing, some days have 23 or 25 hours due to daylight saving time, and the standard Gregorian calendar uses months of differing lengths. And then there are leap years!

To simplify manipulation of and iteration over time intervals, D3 provides a handful of time utilities in addition to the time scale and format. The utilities support both local time and UTC time. Local time is determined by the browser's JavaScript runtime; arbitrary time zone support would be nice, but requires access to the Olson zoneinfo files.
