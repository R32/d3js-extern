/**
A transition is a special type of selection where the operators apply smoothly over time rather than instantaneously. You derive a transition from a selection using the transition operator. While transitions generally support the same operators as selections (such as attr and style), not all operators are supported; for example, you must append elements before a transition starts. A remove operator is provided for convenient removal of elements when the transition ends.

Transitions may have per-element delays and durations, computed using functions of data similar to other operators. This makes it easy to stagger a transition for different elements, either based on data or index. For example, you can sort elements and then stagger the transition for better perception of element reordering during the transition. For more details on these techniques, see "Animated Transitions in Statistical Data Graphics" by Heer & Robertson.

D3 has many built-in interpolators to simplify the transitioning of arbitrary values. For instance, you can transition from the font string "500 12px sans-serif" to "300 42px sans-serif", and D3 will find the numbers embedded within the string, interpolating both font size and weight automatically. You can even interpolate arbitrary nested objects and arrays or SVG path data. D3 allows custom interpolators should you find the built-in ones insufficient, using the attrTween and styleTween operators. D3's interpolators provide the basis for scales and can be used outside of transitions; an interpolator is a function that maps a parametric value t in the domain [0,1] to a color, number or arbitrary value.

Multiple transitions may operate on any selection sequentially or in parallel. Sequential transitions on a selection are enabled by chaining transitions using transition.transition. Parallel transitions on a selection are enabled by assigning each parallel transition a unique name. Only one transition with a given name may be active on a given element at a given time. However, multiple transitions with the same name may be scheduled on the same element; provided they are staggered in time, each transition will run in sequence. If a newer transition runs on a given element, it implicitly cancels any older transitions with the same name, including any that were scheduled but not yet run. This allows new transitions, such as those in response to a new user event, to supersede older transitions even if those older transitions are staged or have staggered delays. Multi-stage transitions (transitions that are created during the "end" event of an earlier transition) are considered the same "age" as the original transition; internally this is tracked by monotonically-increasing unique IDs which are inherited when multi-stage transitions are created. To interrupt an in-progress transition, use selection.interrupt.

	Setting the delay to be a multiple of the index i is a convenient way to stagger transitions for elements. For example, if you used a fixed duration of duration, and have n elements in the current selection, you can stagger the transition over 2 * duration by saying: 
	
	```js
	// cb(data, i, j):delay{ this -> DOM Node}
	.delay(function(d, i) { return i / n * duration; })

The return value of tween must be an interpolator: a function that maps a parametric value t in the domain [0,1] to a color, number or arbitrary value.

	For example, the attr operator is built on top of the attrTween operator. The tween function used by the attr operator depends on whether the end value is a function or a constant. If the end value is a function: 
	
	```js
	function tween(d, i, a) {

	The attrTween operator is used when you need a custom interpolator, such as one that understands the semantics of SVG path data. One common technique is dataspace interpolation, where interpolateObject is used to interpolate two data values, and the result of this interpolation is then used (say, with a shape) to compute the new attribute value. Use the attr operator for the simpler common case where an interpolator can be automatically derived from the current attribute value to the desired end value.

If value is a constant, then all elements are transitioned to the same style property value; otherwise, if value is a function, then the function is evaluated for each selected element (in order), being passed the current datum d and the current index i, with the this context as the current DOM element. The function's return value is then used to transition each element's style property.

	Note that the computed starting value may be different than the value that was previously set, particularly if the style property was set using a shorthand property (such as the "font" style, which is shorthand for "font-size", "font-face", etc.). Moreover, computed dimensions such as "font-size" and "line-height" are always in pixels, so you should specify the ending value in pixels too if appropriate.

The factory should return the tween function to be called over the course of the transition. The tween function is then called repeatedly, being passed the current normalized time t in [0, 1]. If the factory returns null, then the tween is not run on the selected element.

	The tween method is used internally to implement `attr` and `style` tweens, and can be used to interpolate other document content. For example, to interpolate text content from 0 to 100:

	```js
	selection.transition().tween("text", function() {
		var i = d3.interpolateRound(0, 100);
		return function(t) {

		};

If the current element has associated data, this data is inherited by the returned subselection, and automatically bound to the newly selected elements.

Like the built-in array filter method, the returned selection does not preserve the index of the original selection; it returns a copy with elements removed. If you want to preserve the index, use select instead. For example, to select every other element:
	
	```js
	var odds = transition.select(function(d, i) { return i & 1 ? this : null; });

	/**
	If type is specified, adds a listener for transition events, supporting "start", "end" and "interrupt" events. The listener will be invoked for each individual element in the transition.

	The start event is invoked during the first asynchronous callback (tick) of the transition, before any tweens are invoked. For transitions with zero delay, this is typically about 17ms after the transition is scheduled. State events are useful for triggering instantaneous changes to each element, such as changing attributes that cannot be interpolated.

	The end event is invoked during the last asynchronous callback (tick) after the transition duration and delay expires, after all tweens are invoked with t=1. Note that if the transition is superseded by a later-scheduled transition on a given element, no end event will be dispatched for that element; interrupted transitions do not trigger end events. For example, transition.remove schedules each element to be removed when the transition ends, but if the transition is interrupted, the element will not be removed. End events can be used as an alternative to transition.transition to create chained transitions by selecting the current element, this, and deriving a new transition; however, this can lead to clock drift over time and thus transition.transition should be preferred.

	The interrupt event is invoked if an active transition is interrupted by another transition of the same name on the same element. The interrupt event is dispatched on the interrupted transition immediately prior to the start event on the interrupting transition. Note that if a transition is cancelled before it starts (such as when a later-scheduled transition starts before a delayed transition), no interrupt event is dispatched.

	If type is not specified, behaves similarly to selection.each: immediately invokes the specified function for each element in the current transition, passing in the current datum d and index i, with the this context of the current DOM element. Any transitions created within the scope of transition.each will inherit transition parameters from the parent transition, including id, delay, duration and easing. Thus, transitions created within a transition.each will not interrupt the parent transition, similar to subtransitions.

	The transition.each method can be used to chain transitions and apply shared timing across a set of transitions. For example:

	```js
	d3.transition()
		.duration(750)
		.ease("linear")
		.each(function() {
			d3.selectAll(".foo").transition()
			.style("opacity", 0)
			.remove();
		})
		.transition()
		.each(function() {
			d3.selectAll(".bar").transition()
			.style("opacity", 0)
			.remove();
    });
	```
	By using d3.select(this) within transition.each, you can even inherit staggered delay across a set of selected elements. This technique is used by the Axis component to support automatic transitions.
