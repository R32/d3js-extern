/**
While it is tempting to use bare objects as maps in JavaScript, this can lead to unexpected behavior when built-in property names are used as keys. For example, if you try to set object["__proto__"] = 42, it probably won't do what you expect. The same is true if you attempt to query whether a given key is defined in the map; "hasOwnProperty" in object returns true because your bare object inherits the hasOwnProperty method from the Object prototype. To avoid these problems, ES6 proposes [simple maps and sets](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:simple_maps_and_sets); until modern browsers support these collections, you can use d3.map instead.

Note: unlike the proposed ES6 map, d3.map still uses string-coercion for keys rather than strict equality.
