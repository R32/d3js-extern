/**
Nesting allows elements in an array to be grouped into a hierarchical tree structure; think of it like the GROUP BY operator in SQL, except you can have multiple levels of grouping, and the resulting output is a tree rather than a flat table. The levels in the tree are specified by key functions. The leaf nodes of the tree can be sorted by value, while the internal nodes can be sorted by key. An optional rollup function will collapse the elements in each leaf node using a summary function. The nest operator (the object returned by d3.nest) is reusable, and does not retain any references to the data that is nested.

For example, consider the following tabular data structure of Barley yields, from various sites in Minnesota during 1931-2:

```js
var yields = [
  {yield: 27.00, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
  {yield: 48.87, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"},
  {yield: 27.43, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Morris"},
  ...
];


// To facilitate visualization, it may be useful to nest the elements first by year, and then by variety, as follows:

var nest = d3.nest()
    .key(function(d) { return d.year; })
    .key(function(d) { return d.variety; })
    .entries(yields);


//This returns a nested array. Each element of the outer array is a key-values pair, 
//listing the values for each distinct key:


[{key: "1931", values: [
   {key: "Manchuria", values: [
     {yield: 27.00, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
     {yield: 48.87, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"},
     {yield: 27.43, variety: "Manchuria", year: 1931, site: "Morris"}, ...]},
   {key: "Glabron", values: [
     {yield: 43.07, variety: "Glabron", year: 1931, site: "University Farm"},
     {yield: 55.20, variety: "Glabron", year: 1931, site: "Waseca"}, ...]}, ...]},
 {key: "1932", values: ...}]

```

The nested form allows easy iteration and generation of hierarchical structures in SVG or HTML.

extern class Nest{
	
	/**
	Registers a new key function. The key function will be invoked for each element in the input array, and must return a string identifier that is used to assign the element to its group. Most often, the function is implemented as a simple accessor, such as the year and variety accessors in the example above. The function is not passed the input array index. Each time a key is registered, it is pushed onto the end of an internal keys array, and the resulting map or entries will have an additional hierarchy level. There is not currently a facility to remove or query the registered keys. The most-recently registered key is referred to as the current key in subsequent methods.
	*/

	/**
	Sorts key values for the current key using the specified comparator, such as d3.descending. If no comparator is specified for the current key, the order in which keys will be returned is undefined. Note that this only affects the result of the entries operator; the order of keys returned by the map operator is always undefined, regardless of comparator.
	
	```js
	var nest = d3.nest()
		.key(function(d) { return d.year; })
		.sortKeys(d3.ascending)

	Sorts leaf elements using the specified comparator, such as d3.descending. This is roughly equivalent to sorting the input array before applying the nest operator; however it is typically more efficient as the size of each group is smaller. If no value comparator is specified, elements will be returned in the order they appeared in the input array. This applies to both the map and entries operators.

	Specifies a rollup function to be applied on each group of leaf elements. The return value of the rollup function will replace the array of leaf values in either the associative array returned by the map operator, or the values attribute of each entry returned by the entries operator. 	
	*/

	Applies the nest operator to the specified array, returning an associative array. Each entry in the returned associative array corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function. The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another nested associative array; otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input array that have the given key value.

	If a mapType is specified, the specified function is used to construct a map rather than returning a simple JavaScript object. It is recommended that you use d3.map for this purpose. For example:

	```js
	var yieldsByYearAndVariety = d3.nest()
		.key(function(d) { return d.year; })
		.key(function(d) { return d.variety; })
		.map(yields, d3.map);		
		// if mapType is specified then return Map, else return Object
	```
	
	Using `d3.map` rather than an object offers conveniences (e.g., the returned map has keys and values functions), and protects against unusual key names that conflict with built-in JavaScript properties, such as `__proto__`.

Each entry in the returned array corresponds to a distinct key value returned by the first key function. The entry value depends on the number of registered key functions: if there is an additional key, the value is another nested array of entries; otherwise, the value is the array of elements filtered from the input array that have the given key value.
